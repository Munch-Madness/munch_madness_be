# Munch Madness 

## Description of this App

Munch Madness stands out from other apps by combining the enjoyment of NCAA March Madness tournament brackets with the purpose of selecting a restaurant to eat at.

Munch Madness gamifies the process of deciding where to eat or order takeout. Using a tournament-style bracket (1 vs 16, 2 vs 15, 3 vs 14, all the way 8v9 etc.) users can select up to 16 restaurants(based on location) and vote on a winner of each restaurant matchup. The winning restaurant advances to the next round until a final champion is crowned. With the ability to invite friends and engage in friendly competitions, Munch Madness takes the hassle out of choosing where to eat and transforms it into a fun and social experience. <b>This app helps people create their own culinary Cinderella Story!</b>
